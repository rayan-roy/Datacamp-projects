# Datacamp-projects

I completed several data science challenges in DataCamp, and here are the solutions to my projects. 


### Project 1: Analyzing words using NLP + web scraping
We all have read the book Peter Pan. However, have you ever wondered what are some of the most occuring words in the book? Which book character were mostly mentioned into the book? These were the questions I answered in this challenge. Taken from the website Project Gutenberg, I scraped off the book online using BeutifulSoup and analyzing different words from the book to answer some of the questions above. Feel free to read the analysis to find out the answer.

### Project 2: The Office
This was a data exploration project using numpy and pandas, along with visualization with matplotlib. Since I am fan of the show, The Office, I decided to do some exploratory analysis and find trends in the show.

### Project 3: Analyzing Password
NIST is an organization that sets up guidelines for having a strong password so that hackers cannot hack. This data challenge was to find out which users followed the guidelines that were set by the NIST, and what percentage of users didn't. The name of the users that didn't follow the guidelines were released. 

The guidelines were:
1. Must be at least 10 characters in length
2. Must contain at least:
3. One lower case letter
4. One upper case letter
5. One numeric character
6. One non-alphanumeric character
7. Must not contain the phrase password (case insensitive)
8. Must not contain the user's first or last name, e.g., if the user's name is John Smith, then SmItH876! is not a valid password.


### Project 4: Time series analysis of Internet Browsers
As we know Google Chrome was born in 2008, and since then it has become the No. 1 search browser in the world. In this data analysis challenge, I explored the exact timelines when Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer started to decline, and whether Chrome kept on growing its market share of customers. The dataset was retrieved from Google Trends dataset.
