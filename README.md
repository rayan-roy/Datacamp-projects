# Datacamp-projects

I completed several data science challenges in DataCamp, and here are the solutions to my projects. 

### Project 1: The Office
This was a data exploration project using numpy and pandas, along with visualization with matplotlib. Since I am fan of the show, The Office, I decided to do some exploratory analysis and find trends in the show.


### Project 2: Analyzing Password
NIST is an organization that sets up guidelines for having a strong password so that hackers cannot hack. This data challenge was to find out which users followed the guidelines that were set by the NIST, and what percentage of users didn't. The name of the users that didn't follow the guidelines were released. 

The guidelines were:
1. Must be at least 10 characters in length
2. Must contain at least:
3. One lower case letter
4. One upper case letter
5. One numeric character
6. One non-alphanumeric character
7. Must not contain the phrase password (case insensitive)
8. Must not contain the user's first or last name, e.g., if the user's name is John Smith, then SmItH876! is not a valid password.
